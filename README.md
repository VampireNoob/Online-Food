## Here I have created a somewhat complex online-food app with React.js and Redux.

You can view a live demo of the project here: https://onlinefood-shop.netlify.app/

## 🙂 Features:

- ✔️ Primarily we're working with Redux here to add and remove items from the shopping cart.
- ✔️ Working with the methods map, filter and find.
- ✔️ We can also vary the number of products.

## A small part of the code where we use the "find" method.
````
const CartItem = ({ cartItem }) => {

    const dishes = dataDishes.find(item => item.id === cartItem.dishId)
    const dispatch = useDispatch();
````
